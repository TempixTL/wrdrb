# Wrdrb üëï

Wrdrb is a web app focused on organizing your wardrobe. This repository is home to the demo made by [Tom Lauerman](https://github.com/TempixTL), [Ryan Fernandez](https://github.com/rfernan8), [Lizzie Ruetschle](https://github.com/eruetsch), and [Alex Walker](https://github.com/awalker3) for Trinity's CSCI 3345: Web Applications final project in the Spring of 2021.

Please note that this repository is (indefinitely) a work-in-progress, and has many features implemented only enough for a convincing demo.
